# Todd-Nitz-ProjectSp2023
Matthew Todd's Spring 2023 Project under Advisor (Alex Nitz).

Simulation file simulates 1000 data points, each containing signal and noise; where noise has a random normal unit variance and signal is a general sine wave Asin(Bx)
Training file uses SBI algorithm to measure, firstly, B while A is fixed, then A and B simultaneously.
